The application was developed using Next.js with TypeScript and SCSS for styling.

Global state management was implemented using React's useContext. This choice was based on its simplicity and suitability for small-scale applications, keeping the solution lightweight and efficient.

The provided code for fetching data had an error that I was unable to resolve after checking the faker.js documentation. In order to continue technical test and reach my goals within the available time, I decided to make a slight modification to the original code. This adjustment does not affect the nature or purpose of the test.

I implemented a basic lazy loading strategy to load and render data on demand, optimizing the user experience and overall application performance.

If I had more time, I would consider implementing the following improvements:

· Fix the original bug
Investigate and resolve data loading issues in the provided code to ensure full alignment with the original requirements.

· Integration of React Query
Manage API requests more robustly with React Query, with built-in support for caching, retries, and automatic synchronization.

· Automated Testing
Add unit tests using tools like Jest and the React Testing Library to ensure code stability and quality.
